Create a Java Class called "MathOperations" with following methods.

Implement a method that takes two integers as input parameters and prints the multiplication table for the first input parameter up to the second parameter.

```java

public void drawMultiplicationTable (int number , int range);

```

Implement another methid that reads a positive integer (n) from the user and calculates the factorial of that numbers (n!) using a loop and return the value.

```java

public int factorial();

```

Create another class called "MathApp" with main method and call both the implemented methods and display the outputs proprly.
