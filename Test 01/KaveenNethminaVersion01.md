### Write a Lottery class that simulates a lottery.

- The class should have an array of five integers named lotteryNumbers.

- The constructor should use the random() function to generate a random number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element in the array.

- the class should also have a function that accespts an array of five integers that represent a person's lottery picks. This method is to compare the corresponding elements in the two arrays and return the number of digits that match.

for example , the following shows the lotteryNumbers array and the user's array with sample numbers stored in each.

Sample Output:

User's Numbers : 4 2 9 7 3
Lottery Numbers : 7 4 9 1 3
Number of matching digits : 2
Matching digits : 2 , 4
