Create a Java class named "TemperatureConverter" with an attribute (double) temperature. Add a default constructor that sets the attribute to 0 and a getter method. Implement a method named "celsius ToFahrenheit" that takes a double value representing a temperature in Celsius as a parameter and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. Add another method named "fahrenheitToCelsius" that takes a double value representing a temperature in Fahrenheit as a parameter and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
Create a class called "TempApp" with the main method. Create 2 TemperatureConverter objects and accept the user inputs for attribute (one as Celsius and one as Fahrenheit) and assign them. Call the appropriate methods and print the values.

Sample Output
Enter the temperature in celsius : 25
Enter the temperature in farenheit : 122
25.0 Celsius is equal to 77.0 Fahrenheit
122.0 Fahrenheit is equal to 50.0 Celsius
